    "question": "I'm an intermediate player looking for a drills-focused session. Can you help me improve my straight drive and my movement to the front corners?",
    "answer": "Sure, I can provide some useful tips and exercises to help improve your straight drive and front corner movements. The key is to mix exercises that focus on your technique, footwork, and shot placement. Here are some recommendations:\n\n**Warm-Up**\n---\n1. 10mins: Court sprints to get your heart rate up and warm up your legs. \n\n**Exercise History 1**\n---\n1. 10mins (5mins each side): Solo Straight Drives - Practice hitting the ball straight and tight to the wall. Focus on keeping your elbow up and racket face open. Aim to hit the ball at around the middle of the front wall.\n2. 10mins: Drive-Ghost (Switch roles halfway) - Player A plays a straight drive while Player B, at the T, mirrors the movement as if they were going to hit the ball. \n\n*Rest 1:30 minutes*\n\n**Exercise History 2**\n---\n1. 10mins: If you have a partner, play \"boast and drive\". One player boasts and the other returns with a straight drive. Focus on moving quickly to the ball and maintaining a straight and accurate drive. \n\n*Rest 1:30 minutes*\n\n**Exercise History 3**\n---\n1. 10mins (5mins each side):\\n Volley to straight drive - Player A volleys the ball to themselves and then hits a straight drive. Player B repeats the same process on the other side of the court. \n\n*Rest 1:30 minutes*\n\n**Exercise History 4**\n---\n1. 10mins: Front corner drives - Player A starts by playing a straight drive, Player B then volleys a straight drive. This is meant to improve your response time when at the front of the court and enhance your ability to still produce a good drive while under pressure. \n\n*Rest 1:30 minutes*\n\nAfter these exercises, make sure to cool down and stretch properly to avoid any injuries. Practice consistently, and you will see an improvement in your game in no time. Be sure to also play games whenever you can, as nothing beats practical match experience. Happy Squashing!",

    "question": "I'm an intermediate player looking for a drills-focused session. Can you help me improve my straight drive and my movement to the front corners?",
    "answer": "I'm sorry, it seems there's some confusion. As a squash training assistant, my primary goal is to provide guidance, tips, techniques, drills, and strategies to improve your squash game. This might include coaching on serve, return, volleys, drop shots, length, patterns of play, court movement, conditioning, and more.\n\nFor example, if you want to improve your straight drive and movement to the front corners, here are some exercises and drills which can potentially aid in this:\n\n1. **Straight Drive Practice**: Spend 10-15 minutes to hit straight drives from the back of the court. Aim to keep the ball tight to the wall with the first bounce close to the back wall. This will improve your length and accuracy of your straight drives.\n\n2. **Bow Movement Drill**: Ghost (mimic without a ball) a pattern of a straight drive and then a dash to the front corner as if you were going to play a drop shot, then recover back to the 'T'. Try this for sets of 10–15.\n\n3. **Frequency Drill**: Player A feeds from the front of the court, Player B hits straight drives from the back. After 10 drives, Player A plays an occasional drop shot and Player B must sprint to the front to play the ball and then recover, continuing with drives.\n\n4. **Boast/Drop Drills**: Working on your front corner shots is beneficial to enforce good movement patterns. A simple drill could be also known as the \"cat and mouse\" drill. Player A plays a boast which Player B must retrieve and then drop, Player A must then volley the drop, Player B plays a straight drive to reset the drill.\n\nRemember to always include a warm up to your training sessions to get your muscles ready and to prevent injuries.\n\nCan you please clarify your situation further?",
