    "answer": "Sure, I'm here to help you amend your `prompt.txt` effectively. By including the requirement to maintain specific drill sequences such as \"Shot 1 – Shot 2 – Shot 3\" unchanged, you ensure that the output will respect this structure. Here's what you can add to the `prompt.txt` to ensure these sequences aren't altered:\n\n### Hard requirements\nMake sure point 6 is already stated clearly as a hard requirement in the document:\n\n6. **Specific drill sequences formatted as \"Shot 1 – Shot 2 – Shot 3\" must remain unchanged.**\n\nThis clarifies that any drill or game pattern formatted in that specific manner must be preserved exactly as it appears in the context. \n\n### Context Section\n\nIn the \"Context\" section, ensure all examples of these specific drill sequences are formatted using the exact pattern you want unaltered, like:\n\n• 7 pts: Conditioned Game: Drop-Drive: Volley Straight Drop - Straight Lob (Backhand)\n• 9 pts: Conditioned Game: Boast-Cross-Drive: Boast - Cross Lob - Volley Drive (Forehand)\n\nBy emphasizing the correct punctuation and format here, it helps clarify what's considered a specific sequence.\n\n### Testing\n\nOnce these changes are made, test the prompt to ensure consistency with the expectations. If the output doesn't fully adhere to the formatting rules, you might need to add additional clarification or examples to the prompt to reinforce the formatting structure.\n\nIf you need further assistance or adjustments, feel free to ask!",

    "question": "Generate a Medium intensity session for the ['backhand'] that includes straight drop and straight lob.",
    "answer": "Sure, I can help you with that! It seems like you're trying to create a comprehensive prompt or template for designing squash training sessions. Let's walk through the key elements and ensure they are incorporated effectively:\n\n1. **Session Structure and Goal**: Clearly specify the structure, including the warm-up and the number of Activity Blocks, as well as the goal of the session (e.g., focus on backhands, straight drops, and lobs).\n\n2. **Exercise Details**: Define the types of exercises and their constraints, such as the point limit for conditioned games and the duration for drills. Ensure the roles switch halfway, and court sides are alternated unless deliberately focusing on one side.\n\n3. **Hard Requirements**: Protect specific sequences (e.g., \"Shot 1 – Shot 2 – Shot 3\") from being altered, and ensure exercises come exclusively from an existing context.\n\n4. **Response to Insufficient Context**: Provide a clear directive on how to respond if there aren't enough drills available in the context.\n\n5. **Output Format**: Include duration, session focus, detailed warm-up activities, and structured Activity Blocks with specific exercises, their durations, instructions, and rest times.\n\nYou've structured your requirements well. I'll ensure the critical elements are included succinctly in the final prompt:\n\n```markdown\nQuestion / Goal\n---------------\nGenerate a Medium intensity session for the ['backhand'] that includes straight drop and straight lob.\n\nYou are an elite squash coach.\nUsing ONLY the drills and notes in «Context», design a full training session\nwhose total length matches the time requested by the player\n(allowed lengths: **45, 60, or 90 min**).\n\nHard requirements\n-----------------\n1. Structure: Warm-up ➜ exactly N numbered *Activity Blocks*.\n2. Each Activity Block contains 1–2 exercises:\n   • Exercises can be conditioned games (with points) or drills (duration).\n   • Default conditioned games length ≤ 9 points.\n   • Default drill length ≤ 3 min. Drill length of 4–5 min allowed only if the session is for professionals.\n   • Switch player roles halfway unless specified otherwise.\n   • Tend to switch court sides unless a single-side focus is specified.\n\n3. Include a rest line after every exercise (e.g., “Rest 1 min 30 s”).\n4. Re-use drill names and wording from Context whenever possible.\n5. If Context lacks enough material, reply exactly: \"I don't have enough drills yet.\"\n6. Specific drill sequences formatted as \"Shot 1 – Shot 2 – Shot 3\" must remain unchanged.\n7. Draw all warm-up and exercises in Activity Blocks from Context; do not invent anything.\n\nOutput format\n-------------\nDuration: <total session duration, e.g. 60 min>\nSession Focus: <the theme or skill being developed, inferred from context>\n\nWarm-up  (total 8–10 min)\n1. <duration>: <drill name>\n2. …\n\nSession\nExercise 1  (<exercise duration including rest, e.g. 9 min 30 sec>)\n• <duration> (<optional specific instructions, e.g., \"Forehand side\" or \"Backhand only\">): <drill name> (Switch roles halfway if applicable)\n• <duration> (<optional specific instructions>): <drill name> (Switch roles halfway if applicable)\nRest 1 min 30 s\n\nExercise 2\n• <duration> (<optional specific instructions>): <drill name> (Switch roles halfway if applicable)\n• <duration> (<optional specific instructions>): <drill name> (Switch roles halfway if applicable)\nRest 1 min 30 s\n\n...\nOptional Exercise\n<rules>\n\nEnd of session.\n\nContext  (do **not** edit)\n--------------------------\n[Context goes here]\n```\n\nEnsure the context you provide includes enough drills and details so that the session can be constructed without issues. With these instructions, you should have a structured way to craft your needed session outlines.",
