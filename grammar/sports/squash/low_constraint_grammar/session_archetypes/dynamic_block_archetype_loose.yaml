description: >
  A session built with high variety, where each activity block is constructed
  independently by randomly selecting a block_type rule. This archetype does not
  follow a single theme for the whole session.

# This archetype has no session-wide constraints; its logic is at the block level.
hard_constraints:
  - type: prefer_complexity_progression

soft_constraints: []

# It is allowed to use any block type as long symmetrical or same side only.
allowed_block_types:
  - same_variant_side_switch
  - same_side_variant_progression # added not present in balanced
  - from_drills_to_condition # added, not present in balanced
  - cross_family_action_similarity # added, not present in balanced
  - symmetrical_same_side_variant_progression_pair
  - symmetrical_from_drills_to_condition_pair
