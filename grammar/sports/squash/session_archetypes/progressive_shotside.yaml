archetype_name: "Progressive ShoteSide"
description: >
  A session that focuses entirely on a single shot side (e.g., forehand-only) 
  by selecting exercises from various families and arranging them in order of 
  increasing complexity.

# --- HARD CONSTRAINTS ---
# Rules that the planner MUST follow.
hard_constraints:
  - type: require_single_shotside
    # The planner will randomly choose 'forehand' or 'backhand' at generation time
    # and filter its entire library of exercises to only those that match.
  - type: prefer_complexity_progression


# --- SOFT CONSTRAINTS ---
# Preferences that guide the planner's choices without causing failure.
#soft_constraints:
#  - type: prefer_complexity_progression
    # The planner will sort the filtered exercises by complexity (allowed_actions)
    # and fill the session from simplest to most complex.

# --- COMPOSITION ---
# This archetype is flexible and can use any block type, as its main constraint
# is applied at the exercise-selection level.
allowed_block_types:
  - same_side_variant_progression
