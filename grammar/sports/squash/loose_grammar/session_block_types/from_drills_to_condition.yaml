block_type_id: "from_drills_to_condition"
description: "A block that progresses from a drill to a conditioned game from the same family, where the game is at least as complex as the drill."
rules:
  block_count: 1
  exercise_count: 2
  # HARD CONSTRAINT: The block must contain a drill followed by a conditioned game.
  allowed_sequences:
    - [drill, conditioned_game]
  requires_same_family: true
  # HARD CONSTRAINT: The complexity of the conditioned game must be greater than or equal to the drill's complexity.
  # Complexity is measured by the number of 'allowed_actions'.
