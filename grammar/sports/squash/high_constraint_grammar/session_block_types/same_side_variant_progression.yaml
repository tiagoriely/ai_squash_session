description: "A block that progresses through two different variants from the same family, on the same side."
rules:
  block_count: 1
  # HARD CONSTRAINT: The block must contain exactly two exercises.
  exercise_count: 2
  # HARD CONSTRAINT: Both exercises must be variants of the same family.
  requires_same_family: true
  # HARD CONSTRAINT: The variants must be different from each other.
  require_distinct_variants: true
  # HARD CONSTRAINT: Both exercises must be performed on the same side (e.g., both Forehand).
  requires_same_side: true
  # HARD CONSTRAINT: The variant with lower complexity (fewer allowed_actions) must come first.
