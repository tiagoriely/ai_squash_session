📘 1. Use consistent structure
Always start with a metadata block (e.g. Title, Type, Tags, Duration, Focus).

Separate sections clearly (e.g. --- or headings like ## Exercise 1).

Include an optional “Notes” section for extra context.

🔤 2. Include rich keywords and synonyms
Use varied terminology in the text: e.g., “cross lob”, “high ball to the back”, “defensive lob”.

This helps match more diverse queries using both dense and sparse retrieval.

🧱 3. Use full sentences when possible
Instead of just Cross lob drill, write:
“This drill helps players practice cross-court lobs from the front under pressure.”

🔖 4. Tag drills meaningfully
Add a Tags: field with useful keywords:
Tags: lob, height, cross-court, recovery, movement

🧩 5. Repeat key phrases in Exercises
Reuse focus points throughout the text (e.g. “switch roles”, “hit with height”).

Repetition strengthens semantic matches for dense retrieval models.

🧠 6. Include “Focus” and “Goals” explicitly
Helps the reranker understand the purpose of the session.

🗂 7. One session per file
Keep each .docx file focused on a single session or drill set to maintain clean granularity.
