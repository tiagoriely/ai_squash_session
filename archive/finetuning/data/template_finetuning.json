  "instructions": "Set up with Player A on the T and Player B in the forehand front corner. After a straight drive and boast sequence, Player B replies with a straight drop that Player A must lift as a high, soft cross-court lob to the opposite back corner; rally stops after the lob. Work in three 9-minute 30-second blocks (90-second rest), swap roles each block, and mirror on backhand if desired. Focus on an open racket face, high finish, and immediate recovery to the T. Finish with an optional game to 15 where every short ball must be answered with a defensive lob."
