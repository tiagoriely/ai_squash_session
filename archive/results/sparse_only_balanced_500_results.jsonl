This should include arm circles, torso twists, leg swings, and light jogging to get the blood flowing and prepare your body for the session.\\n\\n#### Activity Block 1: Conditioned Game - Cross Shot Focus\\nDuration: 20 minutes\\nPlay a conditioned game where you can only win points by hitting successful cross court drives. Work on depth and precision, aiming to keep the opponent under pressure with a well-timed cross.\\n\\n#### Activity Block 2: Conditioned Game - Drive Shot Focus\\nDuration: 20 minutes\\nIn this game, focus solely on the drive shots, alternating between cross court and straight drive. The goal is to maintain control and accuracy, focusing on how to create openings and capitalize on them using strong drives.\\n\\n#### Activity Block 3: Volley Work\\nDuration: 10 minutes\\nFinish off with volley exercises. Work on both volley drops and volley drives. Start with cooperative drills focusing on maintaining a rally using volleys, then progress to a competitive point-based volley game.\\n\\n#### Cool Down\\nSpend the final 5 minutes stretching major muscle groups, focusing on the shoulders, quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves to aid in recovery and flexibility.\"\n}\n```", "contexts": ["Duration: 45 min\nSession Focus: Dynamic Block Session (Archetype: Dynamic Block Session)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n### Warm-up ###\n• 3 min: Drill: Warmup: Compound Boast-Drive + 2 shots\n• 3 min: Drill: Warmup: Compound Boast-Drive + 2 shots\n\n### Activity Block 1 ###\n• 3 min: Drill: Drop-Drive: Volley Straight Drop - Straight Lob (Forehand)\n  (Rule: Straight Lob: Must be hit above the service line on the front wall,...)\n• 3 min: Drill: Drop-Drive: Volley Straight Drop - Straight Lob (Backhand)\n  (Rule: Straight Lob: Must be hit above the service line on the front wall,...)\n• Rest: 1.5 min\n\n### Activity Block 2 ###\n• 3 min: Drill: Drop-Drive: Drop-Drive (Deep Only) (Forehand)\n  (Rule: Drive: all drives first bounces must land behind T-line.
