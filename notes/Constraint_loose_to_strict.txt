Now we need to think of what we generate for the corpus analysis. We have been on all sorts of loose to strict constraints. We defined 3 big categories of constraints: exercises, archetypes & blocks, and structures.



Context-free grammar (EBNF) and PEG was enforced

Many other constraints where enforced:

1)exercise: same as sequence or general allowed actions, rules with or without sequence (peg) and context_formal (peg), general or specialised variants, 2 types or only one type of shotside, ...

2) structure loose or strict ebnf, duration from less picky to picky, one subdirctory mix structure for loose



3) archetype and blocks: expanding or reducing allowed blocks in archetypes, keeping some constaints everywhere, reducing similary threshold, require_action_similarty in blocks reduced or augmented


Problem faced:
- deleting sequence had an impact
